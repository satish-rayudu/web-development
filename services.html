    <div class="content"><h3>Fullstack python <span>developer:</span></h3>
        <p>
        As a Full Stack Python Developer, I design, develop, 
        and maintain web applications using Python for both front-end and back-end tasks.
        I build user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and develop server-side
        logic with frameworks like Django or Flask. I manage databases, deploy applications
        on cloud services, and implement CI/CD pipelines. Proficiency in Python, 
        front-end technologies, and DevOps practices are essential for my role. 
        I ensure seamless integration and functionality across the entire technology stack.

        <h3>Front-end web <span>developer:</span></h3>
        <p>
            As a Front-End Web Developer, I create the visual and interactive aspects of websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I translate design mockups into responsive, user-friendly web pages, ensuring they work well across different browsers and devices. I enhance user experience by optimizing web pages for performance and accessibility. I also use front-end frameworks like React or Angular to streamline development and collaborate with designers and back-end developers for seamless integration. My role ensures that websites are visually appealing, functional, and efficient.

        <h3>Data <span>analyst:</span></h3>
        <p>
            So, when I think about the role of a Full Stack Data Analyst, I see myself as someone who's in charge of handling all things data, from collecting it to making sense of it all. I use my technical skills to clean up and analyze data, and then turn it into insights that businesses can actually use. It's like I'm the master of data, fluent in languages like Python and tools like SQL and Tableau.

            As for the Support Engineer, I picture myself as the hero of tech problems. I'm the one you call when something goes wrong with your software or hardware. I figure out what's causing the issue, keep everything running smoothly, and work with teams to make things better. With my mix of problem-solving and tech know-how, I make sure customers are always happy.
