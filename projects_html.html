    <div class="content"><h3>Gui <span>calculater:</span></h3>
        <p>
            I developed a <span>GUI calculator</span> using Python's  <span>Tkinter library</span>, providing a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations. The design includes standard features like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A standout feature is the addition of a <span>backspace button</span>, allowing users to easily correct input errors. This project showcases practical application of GUI design and functionality enhancements.

        <h3>Password <span>generator:</span></h3>
        <p>
            I created a <span>Password generator</span> using Python's <span>Tkinter library</span>, offering a simple and intuitive interface for generating secure passwords. The generator allows users to customize password length and character types. A key highlight is the integration of the <span>pyperclip library</span>, which enables users to easily <span>copy generated passwords</span> to the clipboard with a single click. This project demonstrates the effective combination of GUI design and practical utility features.        <br>
